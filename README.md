This project focused on the principles of object detection and classification using CNNs and Keras deep learning library. 
<br>In this project, given an input image, the model was able to classify amongst the trained set of pokemons and produce accurate results as per the expectations. 
<br>Technologies used in this project are CNNs, Keras, Tensorflow and Microsoft Search Bing API for the preparation of the training dataset.
